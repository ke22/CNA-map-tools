## 🎯 Your Requirements

1. **The Economist color palette** as defaults
2. **Three boundary modes:**
   - Country only
   - Country + State
   - Country + State + City
3. **Independent colors per level:**
   - Can color Taiwan (country) = blue
   - Can color Taipei City (city) = red
   - Both visible at once!
