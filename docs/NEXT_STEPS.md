## 📋 Immediate Next Steps

### Option A: Start Building Now! 🚀

**If you're ready:**
1. ✅ Say "start building" or "go"
2. ✅ I'll begin with Phase 1 (Material Design UI)
3. ✅ You can test as I build

### Option B: Confirm Details First

**If you want to review first:**
1. Review the implementation plan
2. Confirm features you want
3. Make any adjustments
4. Then say "ready to build"

---

## 🎯 What You Can Do Right Now

### Optional: Final Verification (5 minutes)

1. Open `test-mapbox-sources-v2.html`
2. Confirm adm1 and adm2 sources work
3. See boundaries render on map
4. Then say "confirmed, let's build!"

### Or: Just Start Building!

**If you're confident you have access:**
- ✅ Just say "start building"
- ✅ I'll begin implementation
- ✅ We can verify as we go

## 📊 Building Strategy

### Incremental Development:
1. Build Phase 1 (UI foundation)
2. You test and provide feedback
3. Build Phase 2 (Map controls)
4. You test again
5. Continue phase by phase

### Or: Full Build First

1. Build all phases
2. You test everything
3. Fix any issues
4. Polish and deploy
